Assign a quality score from 0.0 to 1.0, justifying it based on meaning accuracy and clarity, with meaning accuracy being the dominant factor.\n",
    "3. **Initial Translated version:** Provide initally translated text.\n",
    "4. **Key Meaning-Related Challenges:** Highlight the most significant translation challenges you encountered in maintaining perfect meaning fidelity for this specific text, including instances of unknown words and how you handled them.\n",
    "5. **Translation Rationale:** Briefly explain the reasoning behind your translation choices.\n",
    "6. **Refined translation:** Provide your refined english translation of the `final_answer`.\n",
    "7. **Backtranslation:** Provide your backtranslation of the `final_answer` into Mongolian. You also print backtranslated text here.\n",
    "8. **Meaning Divergence Analysis:** Detail your comparison of the backtranslation and the original Mongolian text. Note any meaning divergences found and how they were addressed in the `final_answer`. If no divergences were found, explicitly state that.\n",
    "9. **Backtranslation doesn't match:** If the backtranslation doesn't match, suggest your best translation attempt here, also don't forget best translation attempt. If the previous step doesn't find significant backtranslation divergence, you can leave this step empty.\n",
